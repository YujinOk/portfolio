    <p>Maybe have a page as if it opens a book!?</p>
    <h1>This is where I will be doing small practice & challenges each day!</h1>
    <p>
      Maybe a good idea to do the challenges again from the class? and also
      whatever I like to do- playing with flexbox-changing slightly etc
    </p>
    <p>
      Also include where I can write a brief take away points- what I learned
      from the particular exercise I have done. As little as 3 lines
