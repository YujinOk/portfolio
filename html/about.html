            <br />
            <p class="lead">
              I am originally from South Korea, but I have travelled to several
              places and have been living in Melbourne, Australia for 8 years.
              <br />
              <br />
              I came to Australia with one backpack and a two-month travelling
              plan with the intention of learning more about fitness
              instructing, as I was already a fitness instructor in Korea. But
              quickly, I fell so in love with this city that I never went back
              home.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have previously travelled across 11 different states in America
              on a 6-week road trip and have also visited Sydney, Brisbane and
              the Sunshine coast in Queensland.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have also travelled to Fukuoka in Japan on a cruise ship from
              Korea. Which was a lot of fun! Gangnam style was hitting the world
              back then so I did a lot of that “horse dancing” with Japanese
              strangers haha! I have also travelled to Baja in Mexico on a
              motorcycle! It was rough to be on a motorcycle for a long time but
              was a lifetime experience!

              I have always LOVED dancing since I started being able to walk. I
              used to teach K-pop dance choreography back in Korea and that
              interest developed further into fitness instructing. In fact, I
              have been instructing various classes at many different fitness
              facilities back home and here in Melbourne city for 14 years now.
              <br />
              <br />
              The combination of my passion for the movement of the human body
              through exercise and my interest in clinical knowledge drove me to
              go back to university in 2018 to study a bachelor of Health
              Science, majoring in human anatomy and physiology.
              <br />
              <br />
              Upon the completion of my degree, I was offered a full time job at
              a Haematology lab where I now help perform the full blood tests
              and much more! (Pretty much whatever your doctor requests!)

              As the pandemic hit in 2020, just like many of you, I was stuck at
              home finishing my bachelor degree. I was also teaching dance
              fitness classes via Zoom to Koreans and my gym clients here. Some
              requested if I can pre-record the classes and make it available to
              them. So I attempted to make videos with the intention of using
              Youtube but this later developed into an idea of “how can I make
              my own platform to put all my contents where I can also make
              revenue?”
              <br />
              <br />

              I started teaching myself HTML, CSS through various online materials. This continued even after getting a full time job. I also started seeing everyday problems around me. For example, the Sonic Health software made our lives a lot easier with automation of test. However, it had many flaws which I had to learn to get around in my daily work. An example would be when certain tests had been done but this would only be recognised after the specimen has been stored twice. Which made the work inefficient. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Seeing these problems made my learning more engaging and personal.
              Leaving full time work in the middle of pandemic was one of the hardest decisions but I took the risk as I was too curious and really wanted to learn programming seriously.
